<p>In the <em><b>Star Trek fictional universe</b></em> faster-than-light warp drive travel via <b>subspace</b>, a feature of space-time that facilitates faster-than-light transit, in the form of interstellar travel or the transmission of information works 
similarly to the Alcubierre Drive, but obeys different laws of physics. Subspace has also been adopted and used in other fictional settings, such as the <i>Stargate</i> franchise, <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> series, the <i>Bobiverse</i> series, 
and <i>Descent: Freespace</i>. In most Star Trek series, subspace communications are a means to establish nearly instantaneous contact with people and places that are light years away. The physics of Star Trek describe infinite speed 
(expressed as warp factor 10) as an impossibility; as such, even subspace communications which travel at speeds over Warp 9.9 may take hours or weeks to reach certain destinations.</p><p>One exception to this impossibility was the episode Threshold 
    (Star Trek: Voyager) where Lt. Paris is everywhere at once. In the Star Trek universe subspace signals do not degrade with the square of the distance as do other methods of communication utilizing conventional bands of the electromagnetic spectrum (i.e. radio waves), 
so signals sent from a great distance can be expected to reach their destination at a predictable time and with little relative degradation (barring any random subspace interference or spatial anomalies).
In the Star Trek franchise, subspace communications have a limit of just over 20 light years before they must be boosted, although this limitation has been ignored in several storylines.</p>

<h3 id="anchor">Warp drive</h3> 
</header>

 <p>Warp Drive is one of the fundamental features of the Star Trek franchise; in the first pilot episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, <strong>"The Cage"</strong>, it is referred to as a <q>hyperdrive</q>, with Captain Pike stating the speed to reach planet Talos IV as 
"time warp, factor 7". When beginning to explain travel times to the illusion survivors (before being interrupted by the sight of Vina), crewmember Jose Tyler stated that "the time barrier's been broken", allowing a group of interstellar travelers 
to return to Earth far sooner than would have otherwise been possible. Later in the pilot, when Spock is faced with the only action of escaping, he announces to the crew they have no choice but to leave, stating "Our time warp factor ..." 
before the ship's systems start failing. In the second pilot for The Original Series, <em>"Where No Man Has Gone Before"</em>, time was dropped from the speed setting with Kirk ordering speeds in the simple <q>"ahead warp factor one" that became so familiar from then on.</q></p>

<h4>Working principle</h4>  

<p>A visualization of a warp field—the ship rests in a bubble of normal space. The basic functional principle of the warp drive in Star Trek is the same for all spaceships. A strong energy source, usually a so-called warp core or sometimes called intermix chamber, generates a high-energy plasma.
This plasma is transported to the so-called warp field generators via lines that are reminiscent of pipes. These generators are basically coils in warp nacelles protruding from the spaceship. These generate a subspace field, the so-called warp field or 
a warp bubble, which distort space-time and propels the bubble and spaceship in the bubble forward.
The warp core can be designed in various forms. Humans and most of the other fictional races use a moderated reaction of antideuterium and deuterium with Dilithium. 
The Romulans, for example, use artificial micro-black holes called quantum singularity.</p>

<h4>Warp effect as depicted in Star Trek: The Next Generation</h4>
<p>The warp drive velocity in Star Trek is generally expressed in "warp factor" units, which—according to Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual—corresponds to the magnitude of the warp field. Achieving warp factor 1 is equal to breaking the light barrier, 
while the actual velocity corresponding to higher factors is determined using an ambiguous formula. According to the Star Trek episode writer's guide for The Original Series, warp factors are converted to multiples of the speed of light by multiplication 
with the cubic function of the warp factor itself. Accordingly, "warp 1" is equivalent to the speed of light, "warp 2" is eight times the speed of light, "warp 3" is 27 times the speed of light, etc. Several episodes of The Original Series placed the 
Enterprise in peril by having it travel at high warp factors. However, the velocity (in present dimensional units) of any given warp factor is rarely the subject of explicit expression, and travel times for specific interstellar distances are not 
consistent through the various series. In the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual it was written that the real warp speed depends on external factors such as particle density or electromagnetic fields and only roughly corresponds with the 
calculated speed of current warp factor. The reference work Star Trek Maps established the theory of subspace (or warp) highways. In certain regions, a spaceship can fly at a multiple of the speed that corresponds to the current warp factor.</p> 
<q>Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again. 
What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived. After all Number One, we're only mortal.

<h4>Modified warp scale (The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Picard)</h4>

<p>For Star Trek: The Next Generation and the subsequent series, Star Trek artist Michael Okuda drew up a new warp scale and devised a formula based on the original one but with an important difference: In the half-open interval from 9 to 10, the exponent w 
increases toward infinity. Thus, in the Okuda scale, warp velocities approach warp 10 asymptotically. According to the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual there is no exact formula for this interval because the quoted velocities are based on a 
hand-drawn curve; what can be said is that at velocities greater than warp 9, the form of the warp function changes because of an increase in the exponent of the warp factor w. Due to the resultant increase in the derivative, even minor changes in the warp 
factor eventually correspond to a greater than exponential change in velocity. Warp factor 10 was set as an unattainable maximum (according to the new scale, reaching or exceeding warp 10 required an infinite amount of energy). This is described in 
Star Trek Technical Manuals as "Eugene's limit", in homage to creator/producer Gene Roddenberry.</p>   
<p>In Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual it was established that the normal operating speed of the Enterprise-D (Galaxy-class) was warp 6 (new scale), the maximum rated cruise was warp 9.2 and the maximum design speed of warp factor 9.6. 
In two episodes, the Enterprise-D could travel at warp 9.8 at "extreme risk", while fleeing from an enemy. According to the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual the Galaxy-class starships and some other starfleet vessels like Nebula-class or 
Excelsior-class were refitted during the Dominion War with newer technology including modifications which increased their maximum speed to warp 9.9.
According to the reference book USS Enterprise Owners' Workshop Manual the Enterprise-E can reach a maximum velocity of warp 9.95. The Star Trek: Starship Spotter reference book states that the Intrepid-class starship Voyager has a maximum sustainable 
cruising speed of warp 9.975, while the Prometheus-class can reach a maximum of warp 9.99, with maximum cruising speed of warp 9.9.
As stated in the collection Star Trek Fact Files, no ship, including highly developed ships like the Borg cube, may exceed warp factor 9.99 with their normal warp drive. To achieve higher speeds, the use of transwarp technology is required.</p>

<h3>Transwarp</h3>
<p>Transwarp generally refers to speeds and technologies that are beyond conventional warp drives. The warp drive has a natural physical or economical limit beyond which higher speeds are no longer possible. 
The reference work Star Trek Fact Files indicates this limit at warp factor 9.99. This is the highest conventional warp speed mentioned for a spaceship (Borg cube). Also in the episode Threshold (Star Trek Voyager) the warp factor 9.99 is suggested as the 
limit. This is the last warp factor mentioned before the leap takes place in the transwarp state.
In the book Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual the authors describes the idea of transwarp:
Finally, we had to provide some loophole for various powerful aliens like Q, who have a knack for tossing the ship million of light years in the time of a commercial break. .. This lets Q and his friends have fun in the 9.9999+ range, 
but also lets our ship travel slowly enough to keep the galaxy a big place, and meets the other criteria. The transwarp concept itself is not tied to any particular technology or speed limit. </p>
