        <h2> Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h3>
        <p>The Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, but would not be able to land. The Falcon Heavy can 
          throw about 16,000 kilograms (when configured to be expendable) on a trans-lunar injection orbit, so 
          it can send a Dragon 2 capsule to the moon with quite a lot of margin. However, in order to land on a 
          surface you need to slow down from orbital velocity, which requires you to change your velocity by a 
          certain amount (which is called your ∆V, literally "change in velocity"). Dragon 2 carries only a 
          small amount of propellant and can only deliver a small amount of ∆V because of that. The exact 
          amount is less than 500m/s, which doesn't come close to the ~1870 m/s needed to land on the moon. 
          It may be possible to do it with two FH launches but that would require additional technology 
          development.</p>
         <h3>What is Red Dragon?</h3>
         <p>Red Dragon is a proposed NASA/SETI Institute mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a 
           Falcon Heavy to the Martian surface. The mission would be an unmanned scientific lander, and the 
           heaviest object ever to be placed on Mars - it alone could carry an additional 2 metric tons of 
           cargo and equipment down to the surface. There have been no official announcements about the mission 
           from SpaceX as the mission design architecture is not managed by them, and there is currently no 
           indication that the project will be funded.</p>
         <h3>Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</h3>
         <p>No. Dragon is too cramped, and would need significant improvements in the life support system to 
           last throughout the long journey. Elon Musk himself has stated that Dragon 2 can support seven 
           astronauts for "several days".</p>
         <h3>Why does the dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of dock?</h3>
         <p>The current version of Dragon physically cannot dock, and can only berth. This is because it has 
           a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) port, and not a NASA Docking System (NDS) port. The advantage of 
           the CBM is that it's 50 inch (1270 mm) in diameter, whereas the NDS is only a 800 mm (31.5 inches) 
           wide. The disadvatage of berthing is that it's a tedious process whereby astronauts carefully 
           maneuver the capsule into place using Canadarm, and then physically bolt the CBM ports together. 
           To unberth, the reverse must occur. Docking by contrast is autonomous, and much faster in both 
           directions.</p>
         <h3>Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</h3>
         <p>The Dragon 1 would make a very poor lifeboat for the ISS. The CRS Dragon does not dock, instead it 
           "berths" to the ISS - this is not automated/machine controlled. Berthing is a tedious process 
           whereby astronauts carefully maneuver the capsule into place using Canadarm, and then physically 
           bolt the CBM ports together. To unberth, the reverse must occur. It is a very slow process; far too 
           slow for a quick escape. There are two Soyuzes attached to Station that are always there and ready 
           to at a moments notice, so it is difficult to imagine a scenario where you'd have to use Dragon as 
           a escape pod... In addition, on top of providing a slow evacuation, the Dragon is only there a month 
           at a time, once every ~6 months or so, has no seats, and is likely to be (at least partially) filled 
           with cargo.</p>
         <h3>Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</h3>
         <p>In all likelihood, no. There are lots of reasons why this would not work: Dragon does not carry 
           enough fuel to reboost the station, the SuperDraco engines are far too powerful, the docking ports 
           Dragon use are incapable of handling the force, the Dragon would not be firing through the station's 
           center of mass, and the Dragon does not have the necessary connections to provide station Guidance, 
           Navigation, & Control. Current solutions to reboosting work perfectly fine. Using Dragon would be 
           too complicated and requires too much effort, whereas current solutions of reboosting the ISS are 
           perfectly capable of doing so without modification.</p>
         <h3>How much Delta V does the Dragon 2 have?</h3>
         <p>According to Hans Koenigsmann at the Dragon Pad Abort press conference, the Dragon 2 weighs 21000 
           lbs (9525 kg), 3500 lbs (1588 kg) of which is propellant. Assuming the SuperDracos have an specific 
           impulse of 235 s, that means the total delta-v of the Dragon 2 is 420 m/s.</p>
         <h3>What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters were to fail during landing?</h3>
         <p>Dragon 2 can lose up to two of its eight SuperDraco thrusters without any problems. The engines 
           will be test-fired at a certain height to check everything as it descends towards landing, should 
           there be a problem parachutes will be deployed, and the craft will splash down in the Atlantic Ocean. 
           There is no chance of a parachute landing on land in this case because the thrusters are required to 
           actively control the vehicle to make sure it descends over land.</p>
         <h3>How does a Dragon reenter the atmosphere and splashdown?</h3>
         <p>First: the deorbit phase starts. The Dragon coasts away from the station to prevent damage to the 
           station from its thrusters. Once it has reached a safe distance, it fires its Draco thrusters, each 
           capable of 400 newtons of thrust, in a sequence to ensure the Dragon enters the atmosphere at the 
           correct angle to reenter safely with the least stress on the PICA heat shield. This deorbit burn 
           takes seven minutes to execute.</p>
          <p>Second: the reentry phase begins. The Dragon's trunk is jettisoned; it's not designed to withstand 
          the heat and forces of reentry and so burns up and is destroyed in the upper atmosphere. The Dragon 
          then orients itself to point its heatshield forwards, but at a slight angle; since the Dragon is 
          loaded asymmetrically prior to its release from the ISS, the capsule can be rotated along its axis, 
          acting like a weak wing, to adjust its trajectory and fine-tune its landing position.</p>
          <p>Third: the landing phase begins. When the Dragon reaches an altitude of 13.7 km, two small parachutes 
          called "drogue chutes" are deployed. These slow down the Dragon capsule and ensure full deployment of 
          the three main parachutes. After the three main parachutes deployed, they slow the Dragon to about 
          5 m/s at sea level for splashdown. Much like the Apollo capsule, the Dragon is able to land with two 
          parachutes in the event of an anomaly with a third parachute</p>
